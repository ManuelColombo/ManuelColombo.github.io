# Strategic Design & Research Highlights

As a design lead and UX researcher, I specialize in driving **user-centered innovation** across diverse industries and multicultural teams. My work blends strategic vision with hands-on research, guiding organizations to align business goals with real user needs.

I lead research initiatives from discovery to activation, using methods like interviews, usability testing, and eye tracking to uncover actionable insights. My experience includes shaping editorial workflows for major news media, informing app design for financial services, and facilitating design-thinking workshops that spark creativity and collaboration.

I believe in making research accessible—translating complex findings into clear, inspiring narratives that empower teams and drive product decisions. My leadership style centers on empathy, curiosity, and fostering a culture where every voice contributes to meaningful outcomes.

While confidentiality limits what I can share publicly, I’m always open to discussing my approach or specific challenges I’ve helped solve. As permissions allow, I’ll add dedicated project pages to this portfolio.
