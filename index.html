        <h3>inconvenient question, I will not be diplomatic</h3>
        <p>
          Today we tend to divide in small subset of skills in order to better
          standardization of the creative production.<br />
          I believe that the true is less simple and much more intriguing. The
          boundaries blurs and greatness speech with other greatness in any kind
          of human creation, from architecture to music, from technology to
          philosophy.<br />
          So who I am?<br />
          I’m a designer and I want to embrace the complexity and the
          contradictions of the real world not to be the sponsor of some
          methodology.

      <H2>where I am?</H2>
      <h3>if I know it, I don’t know my speed</h3>
      <p>
        I'm based near Milan,<br />
        I’m a huge fan of being where the other human beings are.<br />
        Video conference and audio call slow every work process,<br />
        not to mention the email.

      <h2>when?</h2>
      <h3>everything is contemporary</h3>
      <p>
        Borges once answered to the question about the coolest contemporary
        poets: “Virgilio, that guy has good potentials”
      </p>
      <p>
        Whe are all contemporary to our experiences.<br />
        In us lives what we was and what we will be.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently I'm a UX designer for Capgemini<br />
        I am a designer for Corriere della Sera until 2017<br />
        for Rcs Mediagroup until 2015<br />
        for ePrice until 2010<br />
        for Lefetloft until 2008

      <h2>why?</h2>
      <h3>asking the right question</h3>
      <p>
        My designer mission is to ask the right question or, at least, a little
        less wrong question over and over again.
      </p>

      <p>
        Only asking I could reach some kind of comprehension of the needs,
        dreams and pains. Only with strong comprehension I could empathize with
        others.<br />
        True Empathy is the 90% of the designer's job, then typesetting comes
        easy.
