# Where Curiosity Meets User Experience
## Welcome to my website. 

I am **Manuel Colombo**, Design Lead and UX Researcher with over 15 years of experience in complex digital projects. I help teams and organizations put users at the center of innovation, but I never settle for the obvious or the routine. I believe in questioning assumptions and exploring ideas from at least three perspectives: my own, the opposite, and a fresh, outsiderâ€™s view. This approach sparks new insights and helps uncover possibilities that conventional thinking often overlooks.

Here you can find my [something about me](/cv/), [Explore my approach to design and research](/approach/), and [read some of my ideas](/blog/)
